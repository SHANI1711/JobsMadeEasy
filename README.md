# Jobs Made Easy

Jobs Made Easy is a web application built using Java Spring Boot and HTML/CSS for the front end. I followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to organize the components. It streamlines the hiring process for part-time jobs for hiring managers and candidates, offering candidates to apply directly or based on availability. JobsMadeEasy is created following software development principles including Test Driven Development, SOLID Principles, Design Patterns, CI/CD, Software Development Lifecycle, and Agile Methodologies.

# Usage Instructions

Hiring Managers:

- HR can create job postings on this platform providing details such as title, location, requirements, and salary.
- They can see a list of all job postings created and delete them if no longer needed.
- A list of all applications for all job postings is also available for hiring managers so that they can select ideal candidates and send interview mail to them.

Applicants:

- Applicants can apply for jobs using two ways on this platform.
- One is to apply directly to the job postings, and another path is application based on availability.
- In the second way, all applicants can provide their availability directly regardless of job postings.
- Hiring managers will be given this availability information so they can directly employ applicants who meet their availability criteria.
